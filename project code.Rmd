## data dictionaries

RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

```{r}
heart = read.csv("heart.csv")
```
### converting categorical values into factors for the model fittings. 
```{r, echo = F}
# factoring the categorical values for easy
heart$Sex = factor(heart$Sex)
heart$ChestPainType = factor(heart$ChestPainType)
heart$FastingBS = factor(heart$FastingBS)
heart$RestingECG = factor(heart$RestingECG)
heart$ExerciseAngina = factor(heart$ExerciseAngina)
heart$ST_Slope = factor(heart$ST_Slope)
heart$HeartDisease = factor(heart$HeartDisease)
```

```{r}
heart
summary(heart)
```
We can see that there is no missing data by calling the is.na method. and we can move forward with our modeling purposes. 


### data wrangle and reformatting

```{r}
heart = heart%>% mutate(Sex = case_when(Sex == "F" ~ 0, T ~ 1)) %>% mutate(ChestPainType = case_when(ChestPainType == "TA" ~ 1, ChestPainType == "ATA" ~ 2, ChestPainType == "NAP" ~ 3, T ~ 0)) %>% mutate(RestingECG = case_when(RestingECG == "Normal" ~ 0, RestingECG == "ST" ~ 1, T ~ 2)) %>% mutate(ExerciseAngina = case_when(ExerciseAngina == "N" ~ 0, ExerciseAngina == "Y" ~ 1)) %>% mutate(ST_Slope = case_when(ST_Slope == "Up" ~ 0, ST_Slope == "Flat" ~ 1, T ~ 2)) 

heart
```

Now we have no string inputs and can start to take a look at the shape of our data. 


### EDA of the categorical covariates: 
```{r}
cat = heart %>% select(Sex, ChestPainType, FastingBS, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, ST_Slope, HeartDisease)
cat_long = cat %>% pivot_longer(colnames(cat)) %>% as.data.frame()

cat_long %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Distribution of Categorical Covariates")
```

### EDA of continous covariates. 

```{r}
num = heart %>% select(Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR, Oldpeak)
num_long = num %>% pivot_longer(colnames(num)) %>% as.data.frame()

num_long %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Distribution of Numerical Continuous Covariates")
```

The max HR data is also pretty nicely normally distributed. 

What we need to do next is to decide what to do with the missing data from the data set. Let's remove the rows with missing data for now for a straightforward approach with the data set. 
### removing missing data rows

```{r}
dat = heart %>% filter(Cholesterol != 0) %>% as.data.frame()

summary(dat)
```

we still have 700 data points, which should be good enough for now. 


### scaling of continuous data
```{r}
dat = dat %>% mutate(Age = scale(Age), RestingBP = scale(RestingBP), Cholesterol = scale(Cholesterol), MaxHR = scale(MaxHR))
dat
```




### final distribution of data

```{r}
cat = dat %>% select(Sex, ChestPainType, FastingBS, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, ST_Slope, HeartDisease)
cat_long = cat %>% pivot_longer(colnames(cat)) %>% as.data.frame()

cat_long %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Distribution of Categorical Covariates")
```

```{r}
num = dat %>% select(Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR)
num_long = num %>% pivot_longer(colnames(num)) %>% as.data.frame()

num_long %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Distribution of Numerical Continuous Covariates")
```


### setting up cv data set for the different machine learning models


```{r}
set.seed(110)
sample = createDataPartition(dat$HeartDisease, p = 0.8, list = F)

training_set = dat[sample,]
test_set = dat[-sample,]

stat.desc(training_set)
```


```{r}
cat = training_set %>% select(Sex, ChestPainType, FastingBS, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, ST_Slope, HeartDisease)
cat_long = cat %>% pivot_longer(colnames(cat)) %>% as.data.frame()

cat_long %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Distribution of Categorical Covariates")
```

```{r}

num = training_set %>% select(Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR)
num_long = num %>% pivot_longer(colnames(num)) %>% as.data.frame()

num_long %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Distribution of Numerical Continuous Covariates")
```


### fitting of a logistic regression model. 

```{r}
mod1 = glm(HeartDisease ~ ., data = training_set, family = "binomial")

summary(mod1)
```


However, this is the first attempt to fitting the data, we can see that there are several good predictors in this logistic regression model. Surprisingly, cholestral is not a good predictor for heart disease, which is contrary to my preconception. I will need to single out cholesterol in the next analysis. 

```{r}
mod_c = glm(HeartDisease ~ Cholesterol, data = training_set, family = "binomial")

summary(mod_c)
```

When fitted by itself, cholesterol does become significant. let's take out some of the other in-significant predictors to observe the differences. 

```{r}
mod2 = glm(HeartDisease ~ Age + Sex + ChestPainType + ExerciseAngina +ST_Slope + Cholesterol, data = training_set, family = "binomial")

summary(mod2)

mod2.1 = glm(HeartDisease ~ Age + Sex + ChestPainType + ExerciseAngina +ST_Slope, data = training_set, family = "binomial")

summary(mod2.1)
```

Now let's check with the a nested model to see if cholesterol is a needed predictor. 

```{r}
lrtest(mod2, mod2.1)
```
There isn't really any difference in adding the cholesterol term, so we can drop it for now. 


### checking model performance - logistic regression 

```{r}
pred = predict(mod2.1, test_set)

predicted = case_when(pred >= .7 ~ 1, T ~ 0)

confusionMatrix(as.factor(predicted),as.factor(test_set$HeartDisease))
```

We get pretty good result for the logistic regression model. But we can even fine tune our output a little bit more by playing around the classification threshold of a logistic regression. 

```{r}
pred = predict(mod2.1, test_set)

predicted = case_when(pred >= .6 ~ 1, T ~ 0)

confusionMatrix(as.factor(predicted),as.factor(test_set$HeartDisease))
```


After trying a few threshold, 0.7 gave back the best outcome. 




### fitting a KNN model 

we want to do cross validation within each iteration as well. so we need to define a train control for the model. 

```{r}
training_set$HeartDisease = factor(training_set$HeartDisease)
```


```{r}
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, p = .9)
train_knn <- train(HeartDisease ~ ., data = training_set,
                   method = "knn", 
                   tuneGrid = data.frame(k = seq(3,50,2)),
                   trControl = control)
train_knn
```


```{r}
plot(train_knn)
```

```{r}
pred = predict(train_knn, test_set)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(pred),as.factor(test_set$HeartDisease))
```




```{r}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number = 5)
grid <- data.frame(mtry = c(1, 5, 10, 25))


train_rf <- train(HeartDisease ~ ., data = training_set,
                   method = "rf", 
                  ntree = 150,
                   tuneGrid = grid,
                   trControl = control)
train_rf



```

```{r}
pred = predict(train_rf, test_set)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(pred),as.factor(test_set$HeartDisease))
```
